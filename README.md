## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting started

Here you can find a step by step guide how to go from freshly created account in the LiveChat Develoepr Program to a fully working LiveChat App ready to be used on your LiveChat account.

> **Warning**
> Before you start make sure you already have a LiveChat account (you can [create one here](https://accounts.livechat.com/signup)). You would also need Ngrok, together with free account, installed on your computer to obtain temporary and secure public domain for your local app (follow [this instructions](https://ngrok.com/download)).

1. Install the `LiveChat Developer Console CLI`:

```sh
npm install -g @livechat/dev-cli
```

2. Check that you are using the latest version and can access CLI:

```sh
lcdev --version
```

3. Login to your LiveChat account inside the CLI:

```sh
lcdev login
```

4. Initialize a new project from our official [Nex.js app template](https://github.com/livechat/next-app):

```sh
lcdev init first-livechat-app
```

5. Install project dependencies and start local dev server:

```sh
cd first-livechat-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

6. Open the HTTP tunnel to obtain secure public domain for your local app:

```sh
ngrok http 3000
```

7. Bootstrap the new LiveChat App providing newly established public domain:

```sh
lcdev bootstrap --baseURL <your-https-domain-from-ngrok>
```
