## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting started

Below you'll find a step by step guide how to go from a brand new LiveChat Developer Program account to a fully working LiveChat application ready to be used on your LiveChat account.

> **Warning**
> Before you start make sure to already have a LiveChat account (you can [create one here](https://accounts.livechat.com/signup)). You will also need Ngrok together with its free account installed on your computer to obtain a temporary and secure public domain for your local application (follow [these instructions](https://ngrok.com/download)).

1. Install the `LiveChat Developer Console CLI`:

```sh
npm install -g @livechat/dev-cli
```

2. Verify that you are using the latest version and can access the CLI:

```sh
lcdev --version
```

3. Login to your LiveChat account inside the CLI:

```sh
lcdev login
```

4. Initialize a new project from our official [Nex.js app template](https://github.com/livechat/next-app):

```sh
lcdev init first-livechat-app
```

5. Install project dependencies and start local dev server:

```sh
cd first-livechat-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

6. Open the HTTP tunnel to obtain secure public domain for your local app:

```sh
ngrok http 3000
```

7. Bootstrap your new LiveChat app by providing the newly established public domain:

```sh
lcdev bootstrap --baseURL <your-https-domain-from-ngrok>
```
